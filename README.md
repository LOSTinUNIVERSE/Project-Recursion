#Getting Started
To get started with the project, clone the repository to your local machine and open the index.html file in your web browser. The project is written in JavaScript, so it can be run in any modern web browser that supports JavaScript.

#How to Use
The project contains several functions that demonstrate the use of recursion in solving various problems. The functions are organized into modules based on their functionality.


#Fibonacci Module
The Fibonacci module contains two functions: fibonacci(n) and memoizedFibonacci(n). The fibonacci(n) function returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence. The memoizedFibonacci(n) function uses memoization to speed up the computation of the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence.


#Merge Sort Module
The merge sort module contains a single function mergeSort(array), which takes an array of integers and returns a sorted array using the merge sort algorithm.
